# Learning React

So Today I ;earnt a lot of new concepts from git and parcel  0
---> Some commands which were helpful for me were as follows  
 git init , git bramch -M main (basically we were changing the name of master to main)
git commit -m "some message" , then we have to add the origin or location were we have to upload our workd to the online server  
for this we use git remote add otigin then path , then some basic commands to move in and out folder are  
as cd.. to move out and cd folder name to a particular folder name , then we can check status by git status  , git add . to add all file name  , then some branch commands are git branch , git checkout bbranch name , git branch -b name for new branch and -d for deleteing it , then to update use git pull name , git merge ;
